    "description": "Donald Trump is scheduled to participate in Bilateral events with the Chancellor of Germany, Friedrich Merz, on June 5, 2025. You can read more about that here: https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/white-house/3427809/trump-to-meet-merz-white-house-next-week/.\n\nThis market will resolve to \"Yes\" if Donald Trump says the listed term during his appearance at this event. Otherwise, the market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nAny usage of the term regardless of context will count toward the resolution of this market.\n\nPluralization/possessive of the term will count toward the resolution of this market, however other forms will NOT count.\n\nInstances where the term is used in a compound word will count regardless of context (e.g. joyful is not a compound word for \"joy,\" however \"killjoy\" is a compounding of the words \"kill\" and \"joy\").\n\nIf this event is definitively cancelled, or otherwise is not aired by June 5, 2025, 11:59 PM ET, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nThis market is explicitly about the scheduled Bilateral Meeting and/or Press Conference with the Chancellor of Germany events (https://rollcall.com/factbase/trump/topic/calendar/). If a Bilateral Lunch is scheduled and broadcast, it will also qualify toward this market's resolution. Speeches, events, or comments that occur outside of the named scheduled events will not qualify toward this market's resolution. If the events contain a Q&A, it will count toward the resolution of this market.\n\nThe resolution source will be video of the events.",
